# Ship RC Firefox releases

## Requirements

* taskcluster-cli installed
* [Ship-it v2](https://shipit.mozilla-releng.net/) access

## Differences between Firefox RC and non-RC

* the `promote` action will be named `promote_firefox_rc` instead of `promote_firefox`
* there will be an action in between `promote` and `push`. This is `ship_firefox_rc`. The relpro flavors, in order, will be:

    1. `promote_firefox_rc`
    1. `ship_firefox_rc`
    1. `push_firefox`
    1. `ship_firefox`

    We may repeat the first two several times if there are issues we don't want to ship the real release with.

## ship-rc

### How
* Click on the corresponding phase button in the [Ship-it v2 UI](https://shipit.mozilla-releng.net/).

## ship

### Background

The `ship` phase should be triggered when the release is signed off. It runs the `update bouncer aliases`, `mark as shipped`, and `bump version` tasks.

### When

An email will arrive to the release-signoff mailing list asking for a release to be pushed to the appropriate channel, such as 'release' for major releases, 'beta' for betas, and so on.

Examples
- `[desktop] Please push Firefox 57.0 (build#4) to the release channel (25%)`

### How

* Click on the corresponding phase button in the [Ship-it v2 UI](https://shipit.mozilla-releng.net/).

* Find the graphid in the Ship-it v2 UI. Every phase is linked to the
  corresponding graph after it's scheduled.

* Announce to release-signoff that the release is live

## Obtain sign-offs for changes

### Background

To guard against bad actors and compromised credentials we require that any changes to primary release channels (beta, release, ESR) in Balrog are signed off by at least two people.

### When

After the scheduled change has been created by the "updates" task, and prior to the desired release publish time

### How

* In context of the other rules, eg
    * Firefox release: <https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules?product=Firefox&channel=release>
    * Firefox beta: <https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules?product=Firefox&channel=beta>
    * DevEdition: <https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules?product=Firefox&channel=aurora>
* Or using the Balrog Scheduled Changes UI: <https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules/scheduled_changes>
