# Notarization

As of June 26, 2019, we started signing mac builds on the mac notarization pool (Fx69). These tasks also notarize the signed builds, and create signed pkg installers.

## Machines

A machine list is [here](https://github.com/escapewindow/scriptworker-scripts/wiki/machines).

We're working on adding deployment support to [ronin-puppet](https://github.com/mozilla-platform-ops/ronin_puppet/). Currently we need to ssh in to debug and deploy fixes.

## General workflow

IScript will:

- extract the files from a dmg
- sign widevine and omnija (autograph signing)
- sign mac, without the mac signing servers
- create a zipfile of the .app files
- send that zipfile to Apple for notarization
- poll Apple for notarization status
- on success, "staple" the notarization to the app
- create tarballs of the .app files
- create .pkg installers and sign them

## Debugging

The code used is [here](https://github.com/escapewindow/scriptworker-scripts/tree/master/iscript).

An error like `iscript.exceptions.TimeoutError: Timed out polling for uuid aa2dc2bc-9059-426e-a292-0bfb575a337b!` means that Apple has taken too long to notarize. We may want to bump the [`notarization_poll_timeout`](https://github.com/escapewindow/scriptworker-scripts/wiki/Testing-iscript#script_configyaml) everywhere. Generally a rerun has fixed this issue.

## Escalation

Aki, Nick, and Simon know notarization the best, and can help debug.
